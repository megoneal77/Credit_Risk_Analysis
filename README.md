# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Jill asked for the credit card risk to be evaluated from an oversampling of data. The data source was a peer-to-peer lending service company. To reduce bias, two new machine learning models are to be utilized, Balance Random Roest Classifier and Easy Ensemble Classifier. 
## Results 
The machine learning models appear to be able to make precision outsomes. However, I would cotinue to test other algorithms in search of better, more accurate ones.
